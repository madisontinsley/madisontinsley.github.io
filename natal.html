        Below, you can see the 7 main planets, but the sign they are in is based off of the moment I was born on December 27th, 2001 at 3:15 PM.

Every planets transits through the constellation correlating to the signs, each transition at their own length. Saturn takes the longest to transition through each sign, taking about 3 years each, while the moon is the shortest, only taking about 2 days. I used AstroCharts to pull up my natal chart, feel free to head to the site to enter yours as well!

As you can see, I have a lot of placements, or planets, in the sign of Capricorn, including sun, venus, and mercury. Then I have two Gemini placements in the moon and saturn. Finally, one Pisces placement in mars and one Cancer placement in jupiter.

As a Capricorn sun, my core values revolve around my ambition and my ability to calculate my next move.
As a Capricorn venus, stability and devotion are important to me when it comes to my relationships.
As a Capricorn mercury, I rarely ramble, I communicate percisely, cutting out details.
As a Gemini moon, I am intellectual, and quickly move through emotions, and my emotions tend to be convoluted.
As a Pisces Mars, I am motivated by my creativity, and I have a tendency to escape through art or video games to release stress.
With Saturn in Gemini, I have more limitations in terms of communication and I work hard to get my point across.
With Jupiter in Cancer, I experience more sensitivity and empathy to those around me.
