    <h1> 7 Main Planets in Astrology </h1>
    <div class="box"
    <p>
        Each planet represents a behavior, from how we communicate, to how we find motivation.
        
        I am excluding Pluto, Uranus and Neptune, which are considered 'generational planets' because of how slowly they transit through each sign.
        
        The main planets include:
        
        Mars, ruling Aries and Scorpio
        
        the planet of motivation, action-orientation
        
        Venus, ruling Taurus and Libra
        
        the planet of romance, finance
        
        Mercury, ruling Gemini and Virgo
        
        the planet of communication and thought-process
        
        The Moon, ruling Cancer
        
        the 'planet' of emotion, inner-world
        
        The Sun, ruling Leo
        
        the 'planet' of core values, illumination
        
        Jupiter, ruling Sagittarius and Pisces
        
        the planet of expansion, dreams
        
        Saturn, ruling Capricorn and Aquarius
